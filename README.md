# 01 Unit cirlce, sine wave

Description:

Get familiar with the unit circle, move from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates. Intro to the unit circle, intro to sine waves

Keywords:

SOHCAHTOA, sine and cosine waves, `ofGetElapsedTimef()`, `ofMap`.

Homeworks:
- Make a composition where you use things learned in class.
- Write all the the error messages that you are receiving while developing. Keep a collection of your errors, learn to debug your code. 


# 02 Path, lines, shapes. Intro to noise

Description:
Create your own shapes changing the algorithm that we have used to draw the circles

Keywords: `ofPath`, `ofNoise`, shapes.

# 03 Vectors

Description: move things around using vectors.

Keywords: `glm::vec2`

Reference: [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/). It is in processing but the concepts are always valid.

# 04 Modulo operator and loops and objects

Description: get confident with modulo and loop. Create object, create a collection of object.

Keywords: `%`, `for`, `class`, `vector<myObject>`

Exercises:

Make 3 applications that have a GUI.

- Make an application that uses the modulo operator and `ofPath`.

- Make an application that uses 3 different sine waves with different amplitude and frequency.

# 05 ofNode

Description: introducing ofNode, How to combine several ofNode instances together.

Keywords:
