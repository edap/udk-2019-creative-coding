# 01 Unit cirlce, sine wave

Description:

Get familiar with the unit circle, move from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates. Intro to the unit circle, intro to sine waves

Keywords:

SOHCAHTOA, sine and cosine waves, `ofGetElapsedTimef()`, `ofMap`.

Homeworks:
- Make a composition where you use things learned in class.
- Write all the the error messages that you are receiving while developing. Keep a collection of your errors, learn to debug your code. 


# 02 Path, lines, shapes. Intro to noise

Description:
Create your own shapes changing the algorithm that we have used to draw the circles

Keywords: `ofPath`, `ofNoise`, shapes.

# 03 Vectors

Description: move things around using vectors.

Keywords: `glm::vec2`

Reference: [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/). It is in processing but the concepts are always valid.

# 04 Modulo operator and loops and objects

Description: get confident with modulo and loop. Create object, create a collection of object.

Keywords: `%`, `for`, `class`, `vector<myObject>`

Exercises:

Make 3 applications that have a GUI.

- Make an application that uses the modulo operator and `ofPath`.

- Make an application that uses 3 different sine waves with different amplitude and frequency.

# 05 ofNode

Description: introducing ofNode, How to combine several ofNode instances together.

Keywords: 

[ofNode Documentation](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/3d/ofNode/)

# 06 Meshes

Keywords: ofNode, ofEasyCam, ofMaterial, ofLight, 3D coordinate system, normal, surfaces.

Resources:
[intro to meshes](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/generativemesh.html)

#07 Meshes and camera
Keywords: addVertex, generative meshes, how to rotate a point.

#08 Audio

Keywords: cone example, waves, amplitude, frequency. Audio input and audio output. Audio analysis, channels and audio buffers. Time domain analysis vs fft analysis. 

Resources:
- This chapter of the [OF book](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/sound.html) is essential.
- This article is a good introduction to [digital audio](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20160101151542/http://www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk/guide/an-introduction-to-digital-audio)
- This website from [Columbia University](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/cmc/MusicAndComputers/) covers all aspect of digital audio, it is a good reference if you want to go deep into this topic.

Homeworks:
- Try out all the examples in the `examples/audio` folder
- Make an audio-reactive sketch in 3d
- Make an audio-reactive sketch using ofPath or ofPolyline in 2D.
